= AsteroidsJS

This is a simple JavaScript game based on the arcade game from the 1970s.

I made it to practice JavaScript programming with my son.

This game uses vanilla ECMASCript 6 features, including the HTML5 2D canvas and window.requestAnimationFrame().

== TODO

Some things we could do to make this game better or more complete:

* Better colors! Black background.
* Ship destruction animatioh.
* Better graphics for ship?
* Better graphics for rocks?
* Better graphics for missiles?
* Rock destruction animation?
* Size/speed of rocks more challenging, should encourage player to use thrust.
* Fine-tune thrust speed.
* Automatically slow down if thrust off?
* Game Over when ship crashes.
* Ability to start New Game (without page reload).
* Scoring?
* Poor performance when lots of rocks? (Less rocks, bigger?)
